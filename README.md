üîç How It Works
StreamGuard uses a multi-layered approach to provide comprehensive protection:
1. Network Level Protection
Uses Chrome's declarativeNetRequest API to block requests to ad servers before they load.
javascriptCopy// Sample rule from ad-domains.json
{
  "id": 1,
  "priority": 1,
  "action": { "type": "block" },
  "condition": {
    "urlFilter": "||doubleclick.net^",
    "resourceTypes": ["script", "image", "xmlhttprequest", "sub_frame"]
  }
}
2. DOM Cleaning
Removes intrusive elements from the page using intelligent selection and heuristic detection.
3. Adblock Detection Bypassing
Employs sophisticated techniques to avoid detection:

Creates fake ad elements that appear to exist
Overrides JavaScript methods used for detection
Intercepts and neutralizes anti-adblock scripts

4. Video Playback Enhancement
Ensures videos play smoothly by removing overlays and fixing controls.
‚öôÔ∏è Customization
StreamGuard comes with an easy-to-use interface allowing you to:
